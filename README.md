# NodeJS Newsletter ðŸ“¨

Front and back end for a newsletter subscription system using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).  
The user inputs their email and a confirmation is sent. Once its confirmed a [Firebase DB](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) is updated with the new info.

Working example [here](http://tomasmaillo.herokuapp.com/). Running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## TODO
- Check that the email hasnt been used.
- Add to DB after email has been sent (to know that theres a pending confirmation), but make sure that the email goes first. 
- Unsubscription method.
- Screenshots for README
- .env.sample file

## How to use
- Sorry, I wouldnt. :D
- I'm still working on it.
